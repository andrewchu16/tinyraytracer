# Tinyraytracer

Tinyraytracer is an attempt to implement a simple Raytracer proof-of-concept in the Go-programming language. It is capable of rendering a scene with diffusion, refraction, and reflection and outputting it to an image. 

This project will be expanded upon to be a complete library including an engine, backend, and frontend.
